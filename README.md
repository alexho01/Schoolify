# 🐍 Python Educational Suite

This project is a **Python-based educational toolkit** that brings together three powerful tools in one text-based interface: a **scientific calculator**, a **grade manager**, and an **interactive quiz application**. Built with a focus on accessibility and reliability, it provides a smooth learning experience for students and educators alike.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Scientific Calculator** – Supports both basic arithmetic and advanced functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentials)  
- **Grade Manager** – Calculates weighted averages and converts scores into letter grades  
- **Quiz Application** – Interactive quizzes with multiple question types (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank)  
- **Unified Navigation System** – Seamlessly switch between modules from a single menu  
- **Robust Input Validation** – Prevents invalid entries and ensures smooth user experience  
- **Error Handling** – Gracefully handles mistakes and edge cases without breaking execution
