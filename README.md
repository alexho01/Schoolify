This Python-based educational suite combines three core tools into a single text-based interface: a scientific calculator with both basic arithmetic and advanced functions (including trigonometry and logarithms), a grade manager that calculates weighted averages and converts scores to letter grades, and an interactive quiz application supporting various question types. The program features a user-friendly navigation system, along with robust input validation and error handling to ensure reliable performance across all modules.
